  In this research paper, Qiyuan Shen has made an attempt to predict the outcome of an esports event of League of Legends by using machine learning algoritms 
  League of legends is a MOBA game like DOTA 2, with 2 teams red and blue playing against each other to take down opponents' bases and towers. Each team will have spawners of heralds, dragons, elite monsters and wards to be placed and destroyed. There are factors like experience, levels and gold which are generated by killing mobs or by destroying towers.
  
  By keeping all of these in mind we plot graphs and analize them to check for depending facors and non-depending factors. 
  We train a model by one of the different algorithams like Logistic regression, Decision trees, SVM, KNN ....
  In this we did by Logistic regrssion. 
  
  # The dataset to be trained must have its features resemble those in the given sample dataset(high_diamond_ranked_10min.csv).
  # Accuracy of our implementation is around 73.3%.
